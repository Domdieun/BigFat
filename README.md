Project: BigFat – Industrial Scale Cultivated Fat Production
Overview This project involved the end-to-end biotechnological design of a manufacturing facility capable of producing 5,000 tons of cultivated porcine fat per year. The goal was to provide a sustainable, slaughter-free alternative to traditional animal fats by leveraging large-scale cell culture and bioprocessing techniques.

Key Technical Pillars:

Cell Line & Medium Engineering: Selected and optimized porcine adipose-derived stem cells for growth in single-cell suspension. Designed a multi-stage media strategy (Proliferation, Priming, and Differentiation) with a focus on cost reduction through growth factor substitution and serum-free formulations.

Bioprocess & Fermentation Design: Engineered a large-scale bioreactor seed train and a primary production stage. This included calculating oxygen transfer rates (OTR), heat removal requirements, and impeller configurations to ensure cell viability in high-volume (stainless steel) vessels.

Downstream Processing (DSP): Developed a pipeline to harvest and refine the cultivated fat. This involved large-scale decantation and separation technologies to extract high-purity lipids from the cell biomass while minimizing waste.

Techno-Economic & Sustainability Analysis: Utilized SuperPro Designer to model the facility's CAPEX/OPEX. Performed a comparative analysis against traditional livestock farming, focusing on land use, water consumption, and CO2 emissions.
